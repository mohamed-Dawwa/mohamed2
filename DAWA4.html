<b>What is big data analytics</b><br>


Big data analytics is the use of advanced analytic techniques against very large, diverse big data sets that include structured,<br>
 semi-structured and unstructured data, from different sources, and in different sizes from terabytes to zettabytes.<br>

<b>What is big data exactly?</b> It can be defined as data sets whose size or type is beyond the ability of traditional relational databases<br>
 to capture, manage and process the data with low latency. Characteristics of big data include high volume, high velocity and high variety.<br>
  Sources of data are becoming more complex than those for traditional data because they are being driven by artificial intelligence (AI), <br>
  mobile devices, social media and the Internet of Things (IoT). For example, the different types of data originate from sensors, devices, video/audio,<br>
   networks, log files, transactional applications, web and social media â€” much of it generated in real time and at a very large scale.<br>

With big data analytics, you can ultimately fuel better and faster decision-making, modelling and predicting of future outcomes and enhanced business<br>
 intelligence. As you build your big data solution, consider open source software such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark and the entire Hadoop ecosystem <br>
 as cost-effective, flexible data processing and storage tools designed to handle the volume of data being generated today.<br>
