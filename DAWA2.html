        What Is Big Data?</b><br>
    Big data is a term that describes the large volume of data – both structured and unstructured – that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis. But it’s not the amount of data that’s important<br>
    . It’s what organizations do with the data that matters.Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business moves.The use of Big Data is becoming common<br>
     these days by the companies to outperform their peers. In most industries, existing competitors and new entrantbr> alike will use the strategies resulting from the analyzed data to compete,<br>
      innovate and capture value.  Big Data helps the organizations to create new growth opportunities and entirely new categories of companies that can combine and analyze industry data These <br>
      companies have ample information about the products and services, buyers and suppliers, consumer preferences that can be captured and analyzed.While the term “big data” is relatively new,<br>
       the act of gathering and storing large amounts of informationfor eventual analysis is ages old. The concept gained momentum in the early 2000s when industry analyst Doug Laney articulated <br>
       the now-mainstream definition of big data as the three Vs:Volume. Organizations collect data from a variety of sources,  including business transactions, social media and information from <br>
       sensor or machine-to-machine data. In the past, storing it would’ve been a problem – but new technologies (such as Hadoop) have eased the burden. The name 'Big Data' itself is related<br>
         to a size which is enormous. Size of data plays very crucial role in determining value out of data. Also, whether a particular data can actually be considered as a Big Data or not, is dependent<br>
          upon volume of data. Hence, 'Volume' is one characteristic which needs to be considered while dealing with 'Big Data'.locity. Data streams in at an unprecedented speed and must be dealt <br>
          with in a timely manner. RFID tags, sensors and smart metering are driving the need to deal with torrents of data in near-realtime.The term 'velocity' refers to the speed of generation of data<br>
          . How fast the data is generated and processed to meet the demands, determines real potential in the data. Big Data Velocity deals with the speed at which data flows in from sources like<br>
           business processes, application logs, networks and social media sites, sensors, Mobile devices, etc. The flow of data is massive and continuous.Variety. Data comes in all types of formats –<br>
            from structured datasets (examples can be seen here, here & here, numeric data in traditional databases to unstructured text documents, email, video, audio, stock ticker data and financial<br>
             transactions. Variety refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data, both structured and unstructured. During earlier days,spreadsheets and databases were the only sources of data<br>
              considered by most of the applications. Now days, data in the form of emails, photos, videos, monitoring devices, PDFs, audio, etc. is also being considered in the analysis applicationsThis variety<br>
              of unstructured data poses certain issues for storage, mining and analysing data.<br> <b>for more infromation</b>
